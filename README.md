# SUBARSHI

  This project consists of creating a graphical application implemented using the WebGL Library “three.js”. The scenario contains the following elements or 
characteristics: 
      • Construction of 3D objects (complex using the basic primitives of three.js. The 3D objects created are textured using both native materials and imported textures 
        – the environment will be contemplated with 3D objects imported); 
      • Camera configuration (it will be possible to switch between a perspective camera and orthographic camera configuration.); 
      • Lights Configuration (there are several types of lights – pointlight, directional light and/or ambient light – being possible to turn off each type of light 
        individually.); 
      • Interaction with the Scene (the user will be able to interact with the scene through the mouse and/or keyboard.); 
      • Animation (objects are animated in order to demonstrate a concept to be illustrated. It is possible to repeat/review the animation.).
